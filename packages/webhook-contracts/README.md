**Status:** SCAFFOLDED — boundary only, no implemented business behavior.

## Boundary

- Must NOT import application or service code.
- Neutral Core: must NOT contain Laundry-specific (or any vertical-specific) terminology.

## Authority

Implementation must follow the canonical specifications indexed in
`docs/authority/kitluy-source-of-truth-index-v1.0.0.md`. Unknown values remain
`[REQUIRED: ...]` — do not guess.
